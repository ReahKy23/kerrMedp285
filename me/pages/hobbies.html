			<dt id="nails">Nails</dt>
			<dd>I actually started to really get into making art after doing my own nails. I started late 2021 towards the end of the pandemic. I have had a lot of diy hobbies in the past because of adhd, but nail art has definitely lasted the longest. Frankly, it largely has to do with me saving money doing them myself (though I do splurge on rhinestones and nail charms). But also, doing my own nails challenges me to be creative. I’d see a tiktok or reel of a pretty set and it inspires me to  try doing that myself. I’ve actually made jellyfish out of 3D nail gel once.<br>

			<dt id="music">Music</dt>
			<dd>Music is something I am very passionate about. Not so much making music but listening to it. I still appreciate the process in making music even though I don't make music myself. I love music so much I have taken two music classes, and I’d recommend them if that may be of your interest (MUSHL 137 and HUM 201).Sound is something that transcends language barriers. I think that not knowing the language of a particular song doesn't inherently prevent you from appreciating it on an auditory level. I strongly believe that music is a hallmark of culture. No matter the civilization, I can guarantee you that it most likely had a music system or music culture.

			<dt id="movies">Movies</dt>
			<dd>I think I turn to youtube more than any other social app out there–though I’m not entirely sure if youtube counts as a social app. I like to watch my long form videos on youtube. Before I would watch short videos, but now I like videos that are more than an hour long. What I watch is dependent on the mood I am in that day. Sometimes I watch vlogs. Other times I’d watch movie commentaries, album reviews, ets. But if I’m in the mood to learn something new, I’d watch documentaries or Ux design videos on youtube. Some day I’d love to upload some long form videos of my own onto youtube.

			<dt id="youtube">Youtube</dt>
			<dd>I am an avid movie goer. I love watching movies. It doesn't matter the genre. If the premise seems fun I’m done. In the summer I like to get the AMC A-list membership and try and see as many free movies as possible. Sometimes that can be hard though if there aren’t that many movies out that month. And then after watching the movie I like to watch movie commentaries on youtube.

				I wouldn't necessarily call myself a seasoned photographer though I may know my way around a dslr. I just really enjoy taking pictures of different things that may catch my eye. Sometimes it's the clouds in the shape of a star or barbie doll hanging on the train tracks. And now I have really gotten into the habit of posting on Instagram as more of a digital diary. I like to post monthly dumps– which is basically when you post a bunch of pictures you took in that month. You should also check out my instagram.
